# 3D intro screen
A starter template for [Three.JS](https://threejs.org/) based intro screens.

Include `?channel=moonmoon`, or `?channel=channel1,channel2,channel3...` in your URL to connect to a specific channel, great for testing!

Include `?stats=true` to enable performance stats (should pop up in the top left corner).

# Development
Before you start, you should have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and NPM installed.
```
npm install
npm run start
```

After running `start`, open [localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234/). The page should automatically refresh when you make a change.

# Building & Deploying

Services like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) have free tiers that can easilly deploy simple static webpages like this.
